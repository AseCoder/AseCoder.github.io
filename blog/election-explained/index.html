	<h1>Finnish parliamentary election explained</h1>
	<p>Also known as d'Hondt's method.</p>
	<p>Take a representative candidate, any candidate.</p>
	<p>The reference number (\(R\)) for the representative candidate depends on their votes (\(V_r\)) and their party's votes (\(V_p\)).</p>
	<p>If \(n\) parties form an election coalition, the coalition's total votes (\(V_c\)) is the sum of the parties' votes.</p>
	<p>\[V_c=\sum_{x=1}^n V_{p,x}\]</p>
	<p>All of the party's or coalition's \(N\) candidates are ordered by their votes in descending order, creating a list where \[a_i=V_r\] where \(1\le i\le N\). Then, \[R=\frac{1}{i}\cdot V_p\]</p>
	<p>(In case of a party coalition, the inverse of \(i\) is multiplied by the coalition's votes, \(V_c\)).</p>
	<p>The 200 people with the highest reference number (\(R\)) are elected as representatives in the parliament.</p>
