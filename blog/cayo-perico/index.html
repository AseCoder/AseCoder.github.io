		<h1>GTA Online: Cayo Perico Heist Tips â€“ a Collection of Resources</h1>
		<p>After the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/987412-guards-now-detect-bodies-of-dead-guards/">Drug Wars DLC</a> release in 2022 and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/16uc2rs/spreadsheet_of_cayo_perico_heist_nerfs_by/">September 2023 nerf</a>, the Cayo Perico heist is now more difficult than in ye olden days. The resources herein claim to be current as of March 2025.</p>
		<h2>Compound Guards</h2>
		<p>I have not compiled these maps, nor tested their correctness.</p>
		<a href="cayo-perico-guards.webp"><img src="cayo-perico-guards.webp" class="square"></a>
		<p><i>A messy map of both initial and new guards and where they can be killed</i></p>
		<a href="guards-2.webp"><img src="guards-2.webp" class="square"></a>
		<p><i>A cleaner map of only initial guards and where they can be killed</i></p>
		<p>On their own neither of the above maps is perfect but together they construct a well-informed picture of the guard mechanics. In the latter I question if the guard, who is at the top of the office and comes down the stairs, can really only be killed in the highlighted area. I have traditionally mauled him elsewhere.</p>
		
		<h2>On Maximising Profit</h2>
		<p class="disclaimer">This section is a work-in-progress. There is a lot of information to cover and many optimisations to study, but here's what I've found out so far.</p>
		<p>The payout is partly up to chance (primary target, cocaine locations), but it can be influenced by:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>setting up the heist as soon as possible to activate hard mode</li>
			<li>setting up the heist after the 72 h cooldown</li>
			<li>completing the elite challenge.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Primary targets, their probabilities before and after the 72 h cooldown, and their values on normal and hard mode:</p>
		<div class="scrollcontainer">
			<table class="styled">
				<tr>
					<th>Primary Target</th>
					<th>&lt; 72 h</th>
					<th>&gt; 72 h</th>
					<th>Value</th>
					<th>Value (hard)</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Sinsimito Tequila</td>
					<td>60 %</td>
					<td>0 %</td>
					<td>$630,000</td>
					<td>$693,000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Ruby Necklace</td>
					<td>15 %</td>
					<td>40 %</td>
					<td>$700,000</td>
					<td>$770,000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bearer Bonds</td>
					<td>15 %</td>
					<td>40 %</td>
					<td>$770,000</td>
					<td>$847,000</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Pink Diamond</td>
					<td>10 %</td>
					<td>20 %</td>
					<td>$1,300,000</td>
					<td>$1,430,000</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
