	<h1>My sea base on Laythe</h1>
	<p>On the 13th of June 2021, I wanted to build a big rocket in KSP. I concluded that a surface base was heavy enough to jusitfy building a big rocket, and I had always wanted to visit Laythe more, so I got to work building a sea base and a launcher for it. The following afternoon I had finished building and testing my rocket, so it was time for the final countdown.</p>

	<p><i>My big rocket after takeoff from Kerbin. 43 Vector engines produce barely enough thrust to get this thing off the ground.</i></p>
	<p>After circularising my low Kerbin orbit, I started my transter burn to the Joolian system where Laythe is.</p>

	<p><i>My rocket's transfer stage has 16 nuclear engines which barely provide a TWR of 0.3</i></p>

	<p><i>I did my transfer burn in two burns. This picture was taken at apogee after the first burn and features Kerbin and The Mun.</i></p>
	<p>In deep space I made a mid-course correction burn which enhanced my Jool encounter and placed me on a near-equatorial fly-by of Laythe.</p>

	<p><i>I arrived at Jool. Yo mama so fat, Jool could fit inside her. Laythe is also visible in the background.</i></p>
	<p>The 2,500 m/s âˆ†v manoeuvre is my Laythe circularisation burn. In Laythe's SOI I fiddled with my orbit a lot. I wanted to place my base so that Jool would be visible in the sky.</p>
	<p>Before entering Laythe's atmosphere, I detached the transfer stage from the base and inflated eight 10m heat-shields.</p>

	<p><i>Here is my base, committing a controlled descent into Laythe's ocean. I was surprised by Jool's absurdly large appearance.</i></p>

	<p><i>The base splashed down safely. I extended the solar panels and communication antenna. I took a Kerbal on EVA in Laythe's oxygenated atmosphere to admire Jool.</i></p>

	<p><i>My base at sunrise. The Sun looks unusual in the small gap between Jool and the horizon.</i></p>

	<p><i>I also captured two other moons of Jool in the same picture. From top, Tylo and Vall. They are the other "big" moons of Jool along with Laythe. The Kerbal do be going through something doe...</i></p>
	<p>This is the end of my first blog post. KSP mods used: Hyperedit (only for testing), Better time warp, Kerbal Engineer Redux, Waterfall, Restock.</p>
