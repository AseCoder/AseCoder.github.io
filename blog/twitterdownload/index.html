		<h1>How to download videos from Twitter</h1>
		<p>For the technologically inclined. Working as of 2025-11-18.</p>

		<h2>1. Finding the video URL</h2>
		<p>When you have navigated to the twitter video you would like to download, open the network tab in your browser's developer tools and refresh the page to record the first requests of the initial page load. Then look for a request whose domain starts with <code>prod-</code>, file name starts with <code>master_dynamic</code> and file extension is <code>.m3u8</code>. This request only happens once and it happens when the page loads. Copy the whole URL of the request. Do not copy the <code>playlist_</code> URL as I've found that that one doesn't include HD streams.</p>

		<p>There is another type of URL, too: its domain name is <code>video.twimg.com</code> and the file extension and file type (<code>x-mpegurl</code>) are the same. There is no <code>master_dynamic</code> file, but I succeeded by copying the URL of the first request.</p>

		<h2>2. Downloading with FFMPEG</h2>
		<p>Using the command prompt, navigate to the directory in which you would like to save the video. Then run the following command: <code>ffmpeg -i "the url you copied" -c copy output.mp4</code></p>
		<p>This points FFMPEG to download the video stream from the internet and save it to a file. The console will spew a lot of nonsense as it downloads each individual <code>chunk</code> of the video.</p>

		<h2>3. Tips & Tricks for downloading livestreams live</h2>
		<p><b>Rationale:</b> The above instructions should work fine for all VODs and other ordinary videos, but Twitter livestreams are another beast entirely. There is more to learn, but here are the fruits of my testing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				When <code>ffprobe</code>'ing the stream <code>url.m3u8</code>, one might find that the stream is composed of multiple <i>programs</i>, each with their own audio and video stream. This is to 	facilitate different video resolutions.
				<ul><li>The desired program can be chosen with <code>-map p:4</code>, where 4 is the desired program index. I've found that if the program is not selected manually, ffmpeg defaults to a low resolution stream.</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If Twitter only provides a <code>master_dynamic_highlatency.m3u8</code>, one can try swapping "high" out for "low" to access the low-latency stream. <b>This is beneficial especially when playing the livestream in VLC instead of the Twitter client.</b>
			</li>
			<li>
				Typically the download will be plagued with audio/video sync issues, parts of the video being corrupted or missing, or <code>timestamp discontinuity</code> warnings from ffmpeg.
				<ul>
					<li>Intuitively the high latency stream should be used for its better stability.</li>
					<!-- ^ does that solve missing video bits (~2 seconds each, random occurences)? -->
					<li>
						One can try downloading the video and audio streams into separate files with <code>-map 0:13 video.mp4 -map 0:14 audio.mp4</code>.
						<ul>
							<li>Oddly this results in high CPU usage (20â€“40%)</li>
							<li>and when the files are combined, the audio is slightly out of sync.</li>
							<!-- combining the separate files works fine (with above issues), so why doesnt downloading both into one file? -->
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<summary>4. Outdated Tips & tricks</summary>
			<p class="disclaimer">(The following tips are not to be used. This section provides some insight and reference into my past testing and mainly functions as a list of bad ideas I've already tried.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>If the download hangs, it might be beneficial to add <code>-rw_timeout [microseconds]</code> before <code>-i</code> to make FFMPEG retry if the network request times out. Try, for example, 5 seconds: <code>5000000</code>. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>According to my experimentation, though, this corrupts the parts of the output file where a network timeout or <code>timestamp discontinuity</code> happens. <b>For this I prescribe <code>-fflags +genpts</code> and <code>-reset_timestamps 1</code> immediately after the input file</b>, though I'm not sure which of these fixes the problem. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>You might also try downloading the video and audio separately using <code>-map</code> and then combining them.</b></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><s>When downloading a livestream live, you could try adding <code>-re</code> to the beginning.</s> <spans style="color: red;">DO NOT DO THIS!</spans> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48479141/understanding-ffmpeg-re-parameter">Reference</a> </p>
				</li>
				<li style="color: yellow;">
					<p><code>timestamp discontinuity</code> is a significant problem when downloading livestreams live. Further experimentation is required.</p>
				</li>
				<li style="color: yellow;">
					<p>When downloading the streams separately, it might not be necessary to run two commands. Just have two outputs instead.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In conclusion, I've found the following works best for downloading a replay of a livestream:
				<br>
				<code>ffmpeg -rw_timeout 3000000 -i "url" -fflags +genpts -reset_timestamps 1 -map 0:[id of video stream] -c copy output_v.mp4</code>
				<br>
				<code>ffmpeg -rw_timeout 3000000 -i "url" -fflags +genpts -reset_timestamps 1 -map 0:[id of audio stream] -c copy output_a.mp4</code>
				<br>
				And then combining the two:
				<br>
				<code>ffmpeg -i output_v.mp4 -i output_a.mp4 -c copy output.mp4</code>
