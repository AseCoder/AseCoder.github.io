			<h1>How to download videos from Twitter</h1>
			<p>For the technologically inclined. Working as of 2025-05-31.</p>
		</header>

		<h2>1. Finding the video URL</h2>
		<p>When you have navigated to the twitter video you would like to download, open the network tab in your browser's developer tools and refresh the page to record the first requests of the initial page load. Then look for a request whose domain starts with <code>prod-</code>, file name starts with <code>master_dynamic_delta</code> and file extension is <code>.m3u8</code>. This request only happens once and it happens when the page loads. Copy the whole URL of the request.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>There is another type of URL, too: its domain name is <code>video.twimg.com</code> and the file extension and file type (<code>x-mpegurl</code>) are the same. There is no <code>master_dynamic</code> file, but I succeeded by copying the URL of the first request.</p>

		<h2>2. Downloading with FFMPEG</h2>
		<p>Using the command prompt, navigate to the directory in which you would like to save the video. Then run the following command: <code>ffmpeg -i "the url you copied" -c copy output.mp4</code></p>
		<p>This points FFMPEG to download the video stream from the internet and save it to a file. The console will spew a lot of nonsense as it downloads each individual <code>chunk</code> of the video.</p>

		<h1>On livestreams</h1>
		<p>The motivation for this explainer came when I wanted to download the Twitter livestream of Starship's third flight test. Downloading stream replays, ie. VODs, was trivial, but I could never get a satisfactory result when downloading a livestream live as it was happening. Looking back, my problems were largely caused by Twitter's shitty streaming infrastructure, no doubt a consequence of Elon, although my limited experience with <code>ffmpeg</code> and video streams probably didn't make the situation any better.</p>

		<p>Twitter has now rolled out 4K streaming and I applaud the changes they've made to the streaming protocol. Live downloads run without hiccups and the bitrate is commendable. These changes required a little research to fully understand, and I now feel confident in my ability to explain:</p>

		<h2>Twitter's streaming protocol in practice</h2>
		
		<p>Everything starts with a HTTP request to <code>master_dynamic_delta.m3u8</code>. This is the <i>index</i> (also known as a "master playlist") and it contains all the <i>variant streams</i> (aka. "programs" in FFMPEG) as a list of <code>dynamic_delta.m3u8</code> URLs, each playlist corresponding to a different video resolution. In my experience a variant stream's <code>dynamic_delta.m3u8</code> resource is continually updated to include the latest <i>chunks</i> of the stream, and therefore repeatedly appears in the browser's developer tools.</p>

		<details class="styled-bold">
			<summary class="h2">Extra: .m3u8 URLs</summary>
			<p>I have observed two kinds of playlists. One kind includes a dozen <code>.ts</code> (chunk) files amounting to 20–30 seconds of video, and the other kind includes all chunks from <code>0</code> up to the latest chunk.</p>
			
			<p>The URL query parameter <code>_HLS_skip=YES</code> determines which kind is returned by the server.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When the url ends in <code>dynamic_delta.m3u8?type=live</code>, all chunks are returned, going all the way back to the stream's beginning.</li>
				<li>When the url ends in <code>dynamic_delta.m3u8?type=live&_HLS_skip=YES</code>, only a dozen of the most recent chunks are returned.</li>
				<li>The Twitter web client seems to first request all the chunks and thereafter only the dozen.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The stream is always served from either a <code>us-west-1</code> or <code>us-west-2</code> subdomain, and I'm on the other side of the globe, so their CDN is probably only limited to those two servers. There is no geographical advantage to be taken, for example by trying to reduce latency by moving closer to the origin server with a VPN.</p>
		</details>
		
		

		<h2>Secret low-latency stream</h2>

		<p>By replacing <code>delta</code> with <code>lowlatency</code> in the URL, one can access a lower latency stream that nevertheless is identical in quality to the higher latency stream. (Both streams are serving literally the same bytes.) It has a few oddities, though:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Twitter client always plays the high-latency stream, so it's unclear where, or if, the low-latency stream is used.</li>
			<li>Instead of all or a dozen chunks, a <code>dynamic_lowlatency.m3u8</code> playlist has only included three or four chunks in my testing.
				<ul>
					<li>This means that seeking or scrubbing a low-latency stream is not possible, because the earlier chunks are not available.</li>
					<li>The <code>_HLS_skip=YES</code> query parameter has no effect on this.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The low-latency stream is not terminated correctly.
				<ul><li>I once tried downloading both the high-latency and low-latency stream. When the stream ended, the high-latency stream's download ended correctly, but the low-latency stream's download process errored and kept trying to read chunks that didn't exist.</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>When <code>master_dynamic_lowlatency.m3u8</code> is <code>ffprobe</code>'d, the resolution of the 1080p and 2160p video streams is <code>none</code> for some reason, but they still work.</li>
			<li>
				But just to be clear, the low-latency stream does have a noticeably lower latency than the high-latency stream (roughly ten seconds) (probably an exact multiple of the 3-second-long chunks so 9–12 seconds).
				<ul>
					<li>The difference in latency is because the low-latency stream's playlist simply serves more recent chunks.</li>
					<li>I've found that the most recent chunk in the <b>high</b>-latency stream's playlist can be <i>10 seconds old.</i></li>
					<li>In contrast, the low-latency stream's playlist's most recent chunk is usually dated at the same second as the HTTP request to the playlist's URL. Therefore I conclude that the high-latency stream is intentionally delaying chunks for some reason.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<details class="styled-bold">
			<summary class="h2">Extra: dating chunks</summary>
			<p>The playlist <code>.m3u8</code> has comments such as <code>#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME:2025-06-08T14:24:09.404Z</code> that each correspond to one chunk (except in the low-latency stream's playlists, where the last couple of chunks do not have this comment). This date format is human-readable. There is another date hidden in the chunks' filenames. For example in <code>chunk_1749828580033639606_156_a.ts</code>, "1749828580033" is the date. It is formatted as <i>milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch</i>. The rest of the number is seemingly random, or at least its purpose is not immediately apparent. (Technically it's possible that the date part could be 3 characters shorter, such that it expresses only second-accuracy.)</p>

			<p>When <a href="https://asecoder.github.io/tools/epochtoy/">parsed</a>, these filename dates are consistently about 5–6 seconds earlier than the corresponding human-readable date comment. It is unclear if this filename date is the starting or ending time of the chunk, but ending time would make more sense in the case of same-second chunks in the low-latency playlist. I doubt they would be serving chunks that are not yet complete.</p>
		</details>

		<h2>FFMPEG and VLC</h2>

		<p>Ever since SpaceX stopped streaming launches (on YouTube), the community has despised Twitter's stream UI, and recently they have resorted to watching the stream with VLC: by entering a <code>master_dynamic_lowlatency.m3u8</code> or resolution-specific <code>dynamic_lowlatency.m3u8</code> URL into the "Open network stream" field, one can watch a Twitter livestream with a better UI and lower latency than in the Twitter web client. The only downside is that VLC cannot seek the stream whereas the Twitter UI can.</p>

		<p>FFMPEG is a powerful beast and was an important tool in my research for this explainer. Here are some example commands and explanations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>ffprobe "master_dynamic_delta.m3u8"</code><ul><li>Lists all the variant streams in the index, and their video resolutions.</li></ul></li>
			<li>
				<code>ffmpeg -i "master_dynamic_delta.m3u8" -c copy -map 0:10 -map 0:11 output.mp4</code>
				<ul>
					<li>Downloads streams <code>10</code> and <code>11</code>, which are usually the 4K video stream and the highest quality audio stream.
						<ul><li>Use <code>ffprobe</code> to determine the correct stream numbers to use.</li></ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>ffmpeg -live_start_index 0 -i ".../dynamic_delta.m3u8?type=live" -c copy output.mp4</code>
				<ul>
					<li>Seeks to the beginning using the <code>-live_start_index [number]</code> option of the HLS demuxer and downloads the stream.
						<ul>
							<li>The number is the index of the wanted chunk. For example <code>chunk_1749828580033639606_156_a.ts</code> is the 156th chunk.</li>
							<li>This number can be roughly guesstimated because every chunk is 3 seconds long (±1 %).</li>
							<li>This option can also be used with <code>ffplay</code>.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Note that the entered input url must <b>not</b> include <code>_HLS_skip=YES</code>, as it would truncate the playlist to only the most recent chunks, when we specifically want all the chunks from the beginning.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When given a <code>master_dynamic_delta.m3u8</code> URL and nothing else, both <code>ffmpeg</code> and VLC will sometimes select a low-resolution stream by default. This is why I recommend selecting the 4K stream in the Twitter UI first, <i>then</i> copying the <code>dynamic_delta.m3u8</code> URL for the 4K stream, then changing <code>delta</code> to <code>lowlatency</code> and finally entering it into VLC. For FFMPEG I recommend manually selecting the best video and audio stream, for example <code>ffmpeg ... -map 0:p:3 -dn</code> selects the fourth program and discards data streams (<code>timed_id3</code>).</p>
