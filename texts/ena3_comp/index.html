	<h1>A day of memories and terror</h1>
	
	<p>It was the end of the world. I had woken up on a warm Tuesday morning. I sluggishly got out of bed and went downstairs
	to have breakfast. I took a piece of bread and started buttering it with vegan butter.</p>
	
	<p>Almost everything we ate was vegan and homegrown, because the greenhouse emissions caused by animals and large-scale
	agriculture were too high. I had gotten used to it.</p>
	
	<p>My dad was watching the news while sitting on the sofa in the living room. "Governments worldwide have declared many
	high-population areas of the world inhabitable" the worried reporter announced. I had known it was coming but I wasn't
	sure when.</p>
	
	<p>Now it had come. Climate change had caused the end of the world.</p>
	
	<p>I had been seeing the effects of climate change for as long as I could remember. Our hometown, located in the eastern
	United States, was hit with tornadoes and severe storms every couple of months. Many buildings in our home's vicinity
	had been abandoned.</p>
	
	<p>I didn't know what would happen next. I went for a walk outside to bring back memories of all the fun I had had with
	other children when I was young. All of those children's families had since moved closer to the poles, into a safer
	environment.</p>
	
	<p>Our school was still standing mostly intact. It hadn't been used for years, though. It would not have been safe to
	travel to school when natural disasters were common.</p>
	
	<p>The basketball court we used to play at was no longer usable. A weather station had been built there to monitor and warn
	of any upcoming storms.</p>
	
	<p>Soon after the announcement on the news we moved to Greenland and my parents, who were well educated innovators, joined
	an international group of scientists trying to solve climate change. The process was long but luckily mankind managed to
	overcome its biggest challenge. I would not be here otherwise.</p>
