	<h1>Living abroad is liberating but exhausting</h1>
	
	<p>It is a dream of mine to live abroad. Getting to choose any country in the world and to live there is individual freedom
	to the maximum. Sure, Finland is great, but there aren't any warm beaches or other tropical places here. If I wanted to
	swim in a lagoon every day, I would have to move abroad to the Bahamas or Maledives.</p>
	
	<p>Living abroad would be an amazing experience. Getting to see and be a part of other cultures would be great. I've heard
	that in the Netherlands and Denmark many people use bicycles a lot more than here in Finland. Moving abroad would be an
	effective way to get away from the car-centric urban planning of Finland (excluding Oulu). Eating exotic foods would be
	fun for a while, but it could get boring quite quickly.</p>
	
	<p>There are a few downsides, though. Moving abroad requires heaps of paperwork and pushing through bureaucratic systems is
	not fun, not even mentioning getting a second nationality. In the destination country one may have to learn a whole new
	language or be paranoid of catching a local disease. Culture shock also sucks. Moving to India or Japan without knowing
	any social customs could get you in embarrassing situations. Worst of all, in Australia there are deadly creatures like
	spiders lurking in every corner. Yikes!</p>
	
	<p>In conclusion, moving abroad would be amazing, but only if you are motivated and willing to do it. It requires a lot of
	work and perseverance, but in the end it will all have been worth it.</p>
