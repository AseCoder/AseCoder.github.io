		<h1>A Letter to the Editor: Waste not, want not</h1>

		<p>I'm deeply worried about our irresponsible and endless consumption. We buy new clothes when our old clothes are still
		whole and we ship whatever from overseas solely for our own enjoyment. At this rate our habits are destroying the
		planet.</p>
		
		<p>Our culture is to blame, for it upholds consumerism. Having nice things is seen as a symbol of wealth and success.
		Companies latch onto people's feelings and emotions in advertisements to sell them things they don't need. In our
		society consumption is a virtue and, worst of all, it is encouraged and rewarded.</p>
		
		<p>The Buddhists have a solution to this problem that plagues the western world. They propose that one suffers from seeking
		enjoyment and that by refusing enjoyment altogether one can live happily and reach nirvana. If everyone adopted this
		Buddhist mindset, we would consume less and we could live more sustainably.</p>
		
		<p>In conclusion, our constant consumption of unnecessary things must cease for the benefit of the planet and ultimately
		ourselves. The Buddhist way of refusing enjoyment, although quite extreme, is capable of ending unsustainable
		consumption once and for all. So, let us take on the Buddhist spirituality and combat the western culture of consumerism
		together.</p>
